//! A unified application model across all target platforms.
//!
//! # Application
//!
//! An application needs to run on all types of esoteric host platforms. To hide trivial
//! platform-specific details, we offers a convenient trait `Application` facade which
//! defined methods, that will be called in a pre-determined order every frame.
//!
//! The most intuitive and simple setup function could be something like:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use crayon::application::prelude::*;
//!
//! struct Window {}
//! impl Application for Window {}
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let window = Window {};
//!     Engine::new().unwrap().run(window).unwrap();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Engine
//!
//! `Engine` mentioned above is the most fundamental module in crayon. It binds various
//! essential systems in a central place, and responsible for running the main loop.
//!
