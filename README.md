Crayon is an experimental purpose game engine, written with a minimalistic modular design philosophy. Its built from the ground up to focus on cache friendly data layouts in multicore environments with entity-component based architecture.

It is loosely inspired by some amazing blogs on [bitsquid](https://bitsquid.blogspot.de) and [molecular](https://blog.molecular-matters.com). Some goals include:

- Extensible through external code modules;
- Run on [x]macOS, [x]Windows, iOS, Android, WebAssembly from the same source;
- Stateless, layered, multithread render system with OpenGL(ES) 2.0+ backends;
- Entity component system with a data-driven designs;
- Unified access to input devices across platforms;
- Asynchronous data loading from various filesystem;
- etc.

*Warning*: This project is a work in progress and far from a stable version right now.

### Quick Example
For the sake of brevity, you can also run a simple and quick example with commands:

``` sh
git clone git@github.com:shawnscode/crayon.git && cd crayon/crayon-examples
cargo run imgui
```
